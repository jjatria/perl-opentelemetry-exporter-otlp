=head1 NAME

OpenTelemetry::Exporter::OTLP::Encoder::JSON - A JSON encoder for the OTLP exporter

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use OpenTelemetry::Exporter::OTLP::Encoder::JSON;

    my $encoded = OpenTelemetry::Exporter::OTLP::Encoder::JSON->new
        ->encode(\@spans);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an encoder class used by L<OpenTelemetry::Exporter::OTLP> when using
the "http/json" protocol. It encodes telemetry data as a JSON string
complying with the 1.2.0 version of
L<the OTLP specification|https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/tree/v1.2.0>.

This encoder uses L<JSON::MaybeXS> to find a suitable JSON encoder. Please
refer to the documentation of that module for details on how you can control
which encoder to use.

This class is unlikely to be of use outside the OTLP exporter.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

    $encoder = OpenTelemetry::Exporter::OTLP::Encoder::JSON->new;

Constructs a new instance of the OpenTelemetry::Exporter::OTLP::Encoder::JSON
encoder. This method takes no arguments.

=head2 encode

    $encoded = $encoder->encode(\@spans);

It takes a reference to a Perl data structure, and encodes it as appropriate
for this encoder. In this case, it restructures the data to suit the OTLP
schema, and runs it through L</serialise> before returning it.

=head2 serialise

    $serialised = $encoder->serialise($data);

Takes a Perl data structure and returns it as serialised data according to
the format used by this encoder. For this encoder, this returns the payload
as a JSON string.

=head2 content_type

    $mime = $encoder->content_type;

Returns the MIME type appropriate for the encoding used by this encoder,
as a value suitable to be used as the Content-Type header in an HTTP request.
For this encoder, this is equal to "application/json".
