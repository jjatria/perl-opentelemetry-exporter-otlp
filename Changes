Revision history for OpenTelemetry-Exporter-OTLP

{{$NEXT}}

    * Fix key name of parent span ID in JSON encoding
    * Switch Metrics::Any client to strict mode, to allow for automatic
      metric name generation. This means the metrics can be exported
      with adapters that don't allow periods (eg. Prometheus). This
      means some metrics had to be renamed:
      - otel.otlp_exporter.failure -> otel.exporter.otlp.failure
      - otel.otlp_exporter.message.compressed_size -> otel.exporter.otlp.message.compressed.size
      - otel.otlp_exporter.message.uncompressed_size -> otel.exporter.otlp.message.uncompressed.size
      - otel.otlp_exporter.request_duration -> otel.exporter.otlp.request.duration
      Also: the `otel.exporter.otlp.success` metric was added for
      consistency.

    * Bump Object::Pad dependency to 0.74 to ensure

      This adds a new dependency on Future::AsyncAwait
    * Fix issues with JSON encoding of timestamps,
      span and trace IDs, and string values
