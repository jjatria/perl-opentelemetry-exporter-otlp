Revision history for OpenTelemetry-Exporter-OTLP

{{$NEXT}}

    * Switch to the internal logger added to OpenTelemetry v0.030.
      This logger defaults to carping to STDERR at a warning level
      for internal messages only. The log level can be adjusted by setting
      the OTEL_PERL_INTERNAL_LOG_LEVEL environment variable to a suitable
      value. This internal logger is weaker than a regular
      Log::Any::Adapter and can be modified either by setting a
      Log::Any::Adapter or the LOG_ANY_DEFAULT_ADAPTER environment
      variable appropriately. Note that OTEL_PERL_INTERNAL_LOG_LEVEL will
      be ignored if an adapter is manually set.

    * Add 'isa' as a dependency and reduce the minimum supported Perl
      version to 5.30. If you are running 5.30 please consider installing
      Type::Tiny::XS which should improve the performance of these 'isa'
      checks.

    * Fix an issue with the default value of the retries parameter

0.018     2024-11-24 01:17:14+00:00 Europe/London

    * Add missing change log entry for previous release
    * Fixed an issue that would result in duplicate counts of the
      'otel_exporter_otlp_failure' counter in some cases.
    * Fixed a bug that would sometimes result in an attempt to sleep
      for a negative number of seconds.
    * Add a 'retries' contructor parameter to control the maximum
      number of retries for failed export requests
    * Document retry behaviour for export method

0.016001  2024-06-28 22:39:20+01:00 Europe/London (TRIAL RELEASE)

    * Add experimental support for logs

    * Bump OTLP Protobuf files to v1.2.0
    * Ensure JSON encoder encodes status messages as strings.

0.015     2023-11-26 16:19:58+00:00 Europe/London

    * Fix key name of parent span ID in JSON encoding
    * Switch Metrics::Any client to strict mode, to allow for automatic
      metric name generation. This means the metrics can be exported
      with adapters that don't allow periods (eg. Prometheus). This
      means some metrics had to be renamed:
      - otel.otlp_exporter.failure -> otel.exporter.otlp.failure
      - otel.otlp_exporter.message.compressed_size -> otel.exporter.otlp.message.compressed.size
      - otel.otlp_exporter.message.uncompressed_size -> otel.exporter.otlp.message.uncompressed.size
      - otel.otlp_exporter.request_duration -> otel.exporter.otlp.request.duration
      Also: the `otel.exporter.otlp.success` metric was added for
      consistency.

    * Bump Object::Pad dependency to 0.74 to ensure
      support for field initialisers
    * Make all shutdown and force_flush methods async.
      This adds a new dependency on Future::AsyncAwait
    * Fix issues with JSON encoding of timestamps,
      span and trace IDs, and string values

    * Bump OpenTelemetry dependency to 0.010, for
      a the working implementation of the API
    * Allow OTLP encoders to encode arbitrary data
      structures, in preparation for the eventual
